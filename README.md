Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology enabling direct communication between the human brain and external devices. Within this domain, Motor Imagery (MI) based BCIs, which interpret imagined movements from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, have shown particular promise for rehabilitation and assistive applications. However, the field faces a critical challenge: the significant variability in EEG patterns across different subjects necessitates extensive calibration for each new user.

Transfer Learning (TL) has emerged as a promising solution to this challenge, allowing models trained on existing subjects to adapt to new users with minimal calibration data. Despite the growing body of research in EEG-MI transfer learning, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols, making it difficult to compare different approaches effectively and gauge genuine progress.

This paper addresses these fundamental challenges through several key contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive benchmark framework that extends beyond the commonly used BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, incorporating multiple public datasets to provide a more robust evaluation environment. Second, we implement and evaluate an extensive set of state-of-the-art TL approaches, providing insights into their relative strengths and limitations. Third, we introduce a novel metric for quantifying domain alignment quality in EEG transfer learning, offering a theoretical foundation for understanding when and why transfer learning succeeds or fails.

To ensure reproducibility and facilitate future research, we provide open-source implementations of all evaluated methods and our proposed metrics. Our work not only establishes new baseline performance metrics but also provides practical insights into the effectiveness of different transfer learning strategies across diverse scenarios. This standardization effort represents a crucial step toward more reliable and comparable research in EEG-MI transfer learning.
